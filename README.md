# 1. Predicting Customer Churn in Banking Using Machine Learning Models

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning classification models. The goal is to compare the accuracy of different supervised machine learning models and select the best one for predicting customer churn.

Objective
The objective is to classify whether a customer will churn or not based on various features (e.g., age, account balance, number of products). This involves training and testing different machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

# 2. Data Segmentation with KMeans Clustering

This project focuses on data segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm. The goal is to apply unsupervised learning techniques to segment the data into meaningful clusters based on inherent patterns. The model aims to provide insights into how different segments behave based on their features.

Objective
The objective is to perform data segmentation by clustering the data into distinct groups using the KMeans algorithm. This will help in identifying patterns or similarities within the dataset that can be used for further analysis or decision-making.
